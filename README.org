* My personal website
This is a page I set up to play around wtih while I complete my Computer Science courses.

- Originally, I was going to build this whole site with a bunch of org
  files and use some built-in emacs packages to convert them to HTML,
  but ultimately I don't think that's going to give me as much control
  as I would like.
  - Realistically, it's probably possible to get the kind of granular
    control that I want with the tools I'm already using, but I don't
    think that would have much application outside of my personal
    systems.
